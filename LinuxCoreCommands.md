## ln: Create Links (Shortcuts)
- **Hard Link**: `ln [source_file] [link_name]`
        It essentially creates another name for the same file
        Deleting the original file does not affect the hard link, as the data remains accessible through the hard link.
- **Soft Link**: `ln -s [file.txt] [link.txt]`.
        (most like pointer in C language)
        If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes a "dangling link" and will no longer work
        it works too with directories

note

-any name inside [] can be changeable and we don't write the '[]' just the name
